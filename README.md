# Hyperloop_2020-2021_code
A continuation from last year's code https://github.com/Kavya9294/hyperloopCode

Things to do.
1) Construct a generic function to accept input from any pin.
2) Construct a generic function to output the data from the pin to call the appropriate accutator.
3) Create a function to calculate velocity and position based on acceleration data.
4) Look into and implement different failsafe methods in case there is a problem with the pod, or sensors, controls, or networking.
